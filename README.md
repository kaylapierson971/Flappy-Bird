# Flappy Bird Clone
This project is a Flappy Bird clone built using JavaFX. The game recreates the classic mechanics of Flappy Bird, where the player controls a bird that must fly through gaps between pipes without hitting them. It was developed as a practice project to explore JavaFX animation, event handling, and game loop logic in Java.

## Features
-Bird mechanics with gravity and jump.
-Obstacle generation with pipes that spawn at random heights.
-Scoring system that increases as the bird passes the pipes.
-Game over screen with restart functionality.
